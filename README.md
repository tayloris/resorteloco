# resorteloco
Matlab Code to solve a couple of partial differential equations that model a spring-pendulum system.  An animation for the motion of the spring pendulun serve for academic purpose.

This code was part of a project in a Mathematical Modeling course given by profesor Minaya Villasana at University Simón Bolívar. You may see some comments in spanish.

It was written for MAtlab2007 I think so there are still some warning message.

Tu run:

Just run the script  "Resorte_Loco.m" and you will see an animation of the spring pendulun.

Inside   "Resorte_Loco.m" you can modify several parameter of the diferential equation

The diferential equation is given in "Sist.m" and the solution is animated by "Simul2.m"
